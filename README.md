Fourier Ring Correlation Implementation
===========================================

Following the implementation by Alex Herbert, this plugin returns the FRC value from a set of two images with the appropriate method. 

It is implemented as an Eclipse Plugin, with Maven dependencies for ImageJ/Fiji.

## TODO

* Implement a plot to display the FSC, the smoothed plot and the selected intercept to have a visual confirmation. 
* Implement a Batch Mode for a folder of images
